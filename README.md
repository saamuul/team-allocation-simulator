**Course:** SC1003 Introduction to Computational Thinking and Programming  
**Institution:** Nanyang Technological University (NTU)  
**Semester:** AY2024/25 Semester 1

## 📘 Overview  
The **Team Allocation Simulator** automatically forms balanced and diverse student teams for the “Introduction to Data Science” course.  

It assigns students into teams of five (or customizable team sizes) while ensuring fairness across:  
- **School Affiliation** – prevents majority from the same school  
- **Gender** – promotes gender diversity  
- **CGPA** – balances academic performance  

The program reads student records from `records.csv` and outputs a new file with assigned team numbers.
